## Roadmap

- Add sound effects and background music.
- Implement Up/Down movement for player.
- Introduce an indicator to display the powers gained by the player.
- Use a progress indicator to visually represent the passing of time in the game.
- Replace the player model 'Mew' with another unique 3D model.
- Replace the 'Treehouses' model with another model. _( The Treehouses model is itself quite complex and has many polygons. And it's repeated usage is just a lot of load for rendering. Looking for different a model )_
- Expand the game's universe by adding more worlds.
